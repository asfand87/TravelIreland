              Dublin is now Ireland’s capital city, the epicentre of all
              activity in the country and a popular spot for tourists, with an
              estimated five million people visiting the city in 2017 alone.
              Consequently, a lot is known about Dublin and there are many
              interesting facts about Ireland as a whole. However, there is a
              lot to this unique city that remains unknown to many as well as
              many fun facts about Dublin.

            In September 2019, Dublin defeated Kerry in the All-Ireland final
            replay to record a stunning piece of history, claiming their fifth
            All-Ireland title in a row.
          </p>
          <p>
            The side have won six of the last seven, and are unbeaten in
            Championship football since 2014. They are many people’s favourites
            to win six in a row.

            The county of Dublin is Ireland’s third-smallest county in size,
            beat only by bordering Louth and County Carlow, yet it is home to a
            third of southern Ireland’s population, and 20% of Ireland’s
            population as a whole.

            One of the most famous places in Dublin City is O’Connell Street in
            the city centre, this includes the O’Connell Bridge, a citizen’s
            route across the Liffey.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is believed the bridge is the only one in Europe to be the same
            size in width and length and was built far back in 1863, replacing a
            wooden bridge that stood there from 1801.

          <p>
            Here’s another of the most interesting facts about Ireland, and
            Dublin specifically. We’ve all watched a famous film with the
            roaring lion introducing us. Well, the very first lion used by MGM
            was a lion named ‘Slats’, who was born in Dublin Zoo in 1919,
            undoubtedly one of the most interesting facts about Dublin.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Slats’ was initially named ‘Cairbre’ and starred on all
            black-and-white MGM films between 1924 and 1928.

          <h3>Irish meaning</h3>
          <img
            src="https://www.worldtravelguide.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shu-Ireland-Clare-DoonagoreCastle-244049320-Patryk-Kosmider-copy.jpg"

          <p>
            In Irish, Dublin translates to ‘Dubh Linn’, which means “Black Pool”
            and is derived from Old Irish Gaelic. It was a lake used by the
            Vikings to moor their trade ships, and this was connected to the
            Liffey, which partitions Dublin today.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other is ‘Ath Cliath’, which means “Ford of the Reed Hurdles”,
            or ‘Baile Átha Cliath’ for Dublin City, which means “town of the
            hurdled ford”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next time you visit Dublin, you will know a little more about
            the famous city, hopefully making you appreciate the intricacies of
            the town that bit more. We hope you enjoyed these interesting facts
            about Ireland and Dublin specifically.
