          <h1>Cliffs Of Moher</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            When you make your pilgrimage to the Cliffs of Moher, you’re coming
            for one of two things: the staggering height of the rock face, and
            the even more staggering beauty of the views from the top. Soaring
            to 214m, the striated stone reaches its long fingers southward to
            counties Cork and Kerry beyond, with a keen eye from O'Brien's Tower
            even able to spot the Aran Islands to the north.

          <h3>It is the site of ancient Irish legends</h3>

          <p>
            Many folklore stories surround the cliffs of Moher. One famous one
            is about an unusual rock formation, at the most southerly point. It
            closely resembles a woman’s head looking out to the sea when viewed
            from the North. This is called Hag’s Head. Local Irish legend tells
            of how an old hag, (a colloquial term for an older, ugly lady or
            witch) called Mal
          </p>

          <p>
            She fell in love with the Irish hero Cú Chulainn and chased him all
            over Ireland. Cú Chulainn did not return her feelings. He finally
            ended up at Loop Head in Co.Clare, seemingly cornered by Mal. As he
            was a superhero of sorts, he saw an exit route and made his escape
            by hopping across sea stacks towards the Cliffs of Moher, using them
            like stepping-stones. Mal, not so nimble as he, went following after
            him but lost her footing and was dashed to pieces against the cliff.
            They say the sea turned red where she fell, all the way to the
            Cliffs. Malbay is thought to have been named after her.

          <h3>A nature spotting heaven</h3>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            This is a significant area of importance for bird species and is a
            specially protected area by Irish and EU legislation. It is a
            breeding site for over 30,000 seabirds and was classified as a
            Refuge for Fauna in 1988. The area is home to large numbers of
            Guillemot and Razorbills, as well as Atlantic Puffins, Peregrine
            Falcon, Kittiwake and Fulmar. Some endangered bird species like
            Choughs also call this place home. While there are many seabird
            colonies on the offshore islands around Ireland, the Cliffs of Moher
            are home to the largest mainland colony. Around the end of March,
            The Atlantic Puffin arrives, a true favourite of many.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the nesting season, bird viewing is possible from any of the
            cliff-side pathways and viewing areas, often with hundreds of Puffin
            to see, which is a very special sight. Binoculars highly
            recommended! Beautiful wildflowers and grasses cloak the cliffs in
            spring and summer. From atop the cliffs dolphins, whales and seals
            can often be spotted. There is also a large population of hares on
            site and a herd of feral goats that live precariously near Hag’s
            Head.

          <h3>The cliffs boast celebrity status</h3>

            As the dramatic backdrop for many movies, TV series, music videos
            and adverts, The Cliffs of Moher have become a recognisable landmark
            on the big screen. Some of the bigger and more recent movies filmed
            at the Cliffs of Moher include Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
            Prince, The Princess Bride, The Yank, Into the West and The
            Mackintosh Man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some might remember the scene from the comedy TV show Father Ted,
            where Father Jack’s wheelchair rolls backwards over the edge of the
            cliff? That’s the Cliffs of Moher. During the filming of Princess
            Bride, the cliffs were portrayed as the Cliffs of Insanity. Many
            productions use the Cliffs of Moher as a focal point to represent
            the rugged wild west of Ireland. Let’s face it…they are rather
            photogenic!

          <h3>Second most popular tourist destination in Ireland</h3>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            While many people believe The Cliffs of Moher to be the most popular
            tourist attraction in Ireland, it actually ranks at number two in
            the list of Ireland’s top fee-paying attractions. The number of
            visitors it attracts comes in just above Dublin Zoo and the Book of
            Kells. It’s no wonder why it receives such large volumes of
            visitors. This natural wonder is a spectacular place to visit, for
            young and old, for nature lovers and photographers. Over a million
            people each year can’t be wrong about its captivating appeal.
